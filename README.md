# Introduction

Hello! Firstly, I would like to thank you for taking the time to view my submission for the Fetch Take-Home Exercise.

# How To Run

To launch the web service, execute `go run .` in the same directory as `main.go`. By default, the IP address is set to `localhost:8080`, but this can be modified by changing the `IP_ADDRESS` parameter.

Requests were primarily tested using Postman, however, the program should work so long as the header includes the key `Content-Type` with a value of `application/json` when executing a POST request.


Thank you again for taking the time to view my submission! I look forward to hearing back soon!
